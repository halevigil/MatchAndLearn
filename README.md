# Matchucation

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from wanting to connect people around the world so they can learn from each other's expertises. Oftentimes, people with niche interests or limited resources find it hard to learn new skills or topics. Our app matches users that are interested in a topic with users that can teach that topic, so they can mutually learn from each other. This promotes interdisciplinary learning across users and gives them the opportunity to explore interests they otherwise would not have been able to learn and meet people they otherwise would not have ever met. Through our app, users can unlock new skills and make new connections.

## Learning points

Through this project, we learned how to come up with a product to tackle a relevant issue in today's society, flesh it out, and develop it. We learned how to go from just an idea to a tangible app. Prior to this project, we had little to no experience with React Native, but we were able to learn how to build a functioning app within 12 hours. Specifically, we learned how to storyboard with Figma and develop applications with React Native.

## Building Process

Our building process started off with brainstorming an idea that fell into one of the tracks. From there, we planned out the features of our app and storyboarded the screens with Figma. After that, we prioritized the necessary screens and divided up the work. Through building our app, we learned how to use React Native and Expo Go to implement all our necessary features. We also used Git to code simultaneously and maintain version control.

## Challenges

Our team faced a variety of challenges while building our app. The main challenges we faced were learning aspects of JavaScript for React Native, coordinating with each other through Git, debugging various issues throughout the coding process, translating the Figma designs to our app, and staying optimistic throughout the whole process. Despite these challenges, we were able to overcome them to create our app.
